Aircraft localization using OpenCV

This is part of the project for navigating mobile robots through the maze using
aircraft equipped with camera.
It consists two parts:
1. Searching the path through the maze using A* search algorithm,
2. Aircraft localization using visual markers

Requires ROS fuerte (http://www.ros.org/), OpenCV 2.4.6 or newer (http://opencv.org/downloads.html).
